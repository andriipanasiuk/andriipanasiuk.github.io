Here I'd like to introduce the process how I'm learning English. I'd rather call this process a study, even a sort of an investigation, because I believe that learning belongs to outside motivation but the investigation is when your interest comes within you.

Also I strongly believe that in every our study we need a mentor. What is a difference between teacher and mentor? The teacher will try to give you a motivation coming outside, so you will learn. While a mentor inflames your interest so you are studying. This study will lead you to the moment when the knowledge is in your blood and you won't even remember that times when you didn't know it.

I was lucky to meet such person. It's Angela Beklemysheva and here are some of home assignments she gives me and some other studies I did myself.
