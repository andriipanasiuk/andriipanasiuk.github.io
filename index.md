# Brandon Amos

Hi! I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, where
I work on machine learning, computer vision, and mobile computing with
my advisor [Satya](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/).
I strive to make all of my work free, open source, and reproducible.

You can contact me at [bamos@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:bamos@cs.cmu.edu).

# Research Projects

+ At CMU, I am the project lead of
  [OpenFace](http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/)
  which provides free and open-source face recognition
  technology with deep neural networks.
+ As a summer intern at Adobe Research,
  I created a web analytics engine with Scala, Spark,
  and Parquet.
  The code is openly available
  [on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe-research/spindle).
+ As an undergraduate at Virginia Tech,
  I researched dynamic Android malware detection,
  which resulted in
  [this publication](http://bamos.github.io/data/papers/amos-iwcmc2013.pdf).
  The code is openly available
  [on GitHub](https://github.com/VT-Magnum-Research/antimalware).
+ As an undergraduate at Virginia Tech,
  I also helped develop parallel versions of quasi-Newton
  stochastic optimization algorithms.
  A preprint of our early results are available as a tech
  report
  [here](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/49672/qnTOMS14.pdf).
  I helped apply QNSTOP and other optimization algorithms to a systems
  biology problem in
  [this publication](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2685662).

# Fun Side Projects
